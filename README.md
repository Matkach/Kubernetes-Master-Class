## Recovering from a disaster with Rancher and Kubernetes
Recover, Restore and Rebuild:​ Disaster Recovery with Rancher and Kubernetes​

Everything breaks at some point; whether it is infrastructure (DNS, network, storage, etc.) or Kubernetes itself, something will fail eventually. In this session, we will walk through some common failure scenarios, including identifying failures and how to respond to them in the fastest way possible using the same troubleshooting steps, scripts, and tools Rancher Support uses when supporting our Enterprise customers. Then finally, to recover from these types of failures in place or scratch. This session includes documentation and scripts for reproducing all of these failures (based on actual events) in a lab environment.
